⚠️ <b>We do not provide code support in our server due to multiple reasons. Edit at your own risk!</b>

## Installation
⚠️ First Make sure you have `Node v18+` or higher version to run the bot ⚠️

Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sandarutharuneth/midjourney-bot
```

Fill your Token and other dependencies at [config.json](https://github.com/sandarutharuneth/midjourney-bot/blob/master/src/config/config.json)
```json
{
    "TOKEN": "BOT TOKEN",
    "API": "YOUR REPLICATE API KEY",
    "CLIENTID": "YOUR BOT ID",
    "OWNER": ["YOUR ID"]
}
```

Get your Replicate API
- Visit [Replicate](https://replicate.com) and create an account
- Get API token [API Section](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens)
- Paste the Key on `config.json`

Install dependencies
```sh
npm i
```

Start the bot
```sh
node .
```

## Run
On your discord server use slash command `/imagine` to get results
Ex: `/imagine midjourney style anime landscape, genshin impact style`

## Common Erros
> IF you have a console error saying about any payment stuff, It means your free usage limit already have been ended and you'll either have to wait till next month get free uses or you can purchase a plan from Replicate to keep generating.
> If you got the output as a black image, It usually means that you used inappropriate prompt to generate an image. Replicate does not allow such a behaviour and you might get banned from the platform. Use prompt wisely!

### PS:
- Add `midjourney style` or `mdjrny-v4` key word somewhere on your promt for better results
